# StepsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.12.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run mock:server` to launch a fake REST API locally. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/series` to see the data. Here are some examples of the different ways to query the data `https://github.com/typicode/json-server`.

The API is also exposed on the public internet from my GitHub repository: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/happyandrewli/tsar-poc/series.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
